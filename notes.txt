This will allow us to work with our models in the Flask shell, because we are injecting. Run
the shell now and use db.create_all() to create all of the tables, as shown in the
following code:
 # Tell Flask where to load our shell context
 $ export FLASK_APP=manage.py
 $ flask shell
 >>> db.create_all()

 fixing :
 pip install --upgrade jinja2
pip uninstall jinja2
pip install jinja2
